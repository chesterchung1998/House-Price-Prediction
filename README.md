# House_Price_Prediction
A simple prediction system that predicts prices of houses using machine learning, based on features such as average number of rooms per dwelling, per capita crime rate by town, and index of accessibility to radial highways. This system utilizes the XGBRegressor model for predicting regression data, and is based on the Boston house-price Dataset in scikit-learn libary.
